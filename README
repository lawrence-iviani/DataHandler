This is a little project with a very simple pattern that allows to maintains, show, import/export data.
The data to manage are Q_PROPERTY and the user must write the get/set logic and the UI. By respecting just  a name convention allows  the pattern to connect all the signal/slot in the right way.
Also an utility to serialize data with a DOM structure is provided, THUS it's very simple to copy/paste data and also to store/import to/from an xml file that can be used for other purposes

More detail in the doc directory.
See test1 as example, two instance are created and it's possible copy&paste data between them also import/export file.
