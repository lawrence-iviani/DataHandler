There are 3 example in this tiny framework.

TEST1
A very simple example and definition of the class.
The 3 class are explained and a very little show on how to use it.

TEST2.
A little bit more complicated, this design can be used when you have some basic class property and UI (in the example data1) that need to be extended with another (data2).
In this design you don't need to inherit some "special" methods from data 1 but only property and UI.

TEST3.
This example explain how data2  can inherits from data1 maintaining not only the property and the UI but also the method.
This example explain also how to keep properties that are already init.
For example data1 ha some internal init that want to  be constant when data2 properties instance its own class.
Also the method upperCaseFoo is kept  in the game (yes, but with an explicit call!!!). THe trick for now is use some protected method.
